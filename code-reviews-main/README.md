## Redeem application
The redeem application, is a small JavaScript and Express application that has quite a few of issues. Can you spot all of them?  

Code Review Description:
This is part of a larger gaming application. The developer just finished the first version of the redeem feature. The feature should allow a player to redeem his credits for more gaming hours.
The higher the level of the player, the less hours of gaming the player can get per credits.
